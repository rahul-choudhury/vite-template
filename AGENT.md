## Development Commands

- `pnpm typecheck` - Run type check
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

## Code Policy

- Use kebab case for file names
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- DO NOT add `import React from "react"` to the top of a new file. This is not needed for react versions >= 18
- Use the `cn` util for writing conditional tailwind classes
- Before creating any new type definitions/interfaces, check the `src/lib/definitions.ts` file
- Prefer using the `function` keyword when creating components/functions over arrow functions
- ALWAYS destructure custom hooks (including query/mutation hooks)
- Only write high-value comments if at all. Avoid talking to the user through comments
- DO NOT run the dev server command
- Before creating any ui components, check for their existence in `src/components/ui`
- Install new components from shadcn/ui (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)

### Dialog Best Practices

- **Never use `AlertDialogAction` or `DialogClose`** for actions that require loading states or error handling
- **Always use regular `Button`** in dialog footers when you need to:
  - Show loading states during async operations
  - Handle errors without auto-closing the dialog
  - Manually control when the dialog closes
- **Reason**: Both `AlertDialogAction` and `DialogClose` have built-in behavior that closes the dialog immediately on click, preventing proper UX during async operations
- **Use controlled dialogs**: For complex interactions, manage dialog state with `useState` and the `open` prop rather than relying on built-in close triggers

### Avoiding `any` Types and Type Assertions; Preferring `unknown`

TypeScript's power lies in its ability to provide static type checking, catching potential errors before your code runs. To fully leverage this, it's crucial to avoid the `any` type and be judicious with type assertions.

- **The Dangers of `any`**: Using any effectively opts out of TypeScript's type checking for that particular variable or expression. While it might seem convenient in the short term, it introduces significant risks:
  - **Loss of Type Safety**: You lose all the benefits of type checking, making it easy to introduce runtime errors that TypeScript would otherwise have caught.
  - **Reduced Readability and Maintainability**: Code with `any` types is harder to understand and maintain, as the expected type of data is no longer explicitly defined.
  - **Masking Underlying Issues**: Often, the need for any indicates a deeper problem in the design of your code or the way you're interacting with external libraries. It's a sign that you might need to refine your types or refactor your code.

- **Preferring `unknown` over `any`**: When you absolutely cannot determine the type of a value at compile time, and you're tempted to reach for any, consider using unknown instead. unknown is a type-safe counterpart to any. While a variable of type unknown can hold any value, you must perform type narrowing (e.g., using typeof or instanceof checks, or a type assertion) before you can perform any operations on it. This forces you to handle the unknown type explicitly, preventing accidental runtime errors.

  ```
  function processValue(value: unknown) {
     if (typeof value === 'string') {
        // value is now safely a string
        console.log(value.toUpperCase());
     } else if (typeof value === 'number') {
        // value is now safely a number
        console.log(value * 2);
     }
     // Without narrowing, you cannot access properties or methods on 'value'
     // console.log(value.someProperty); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.
  }
  ```

- **Type Assertions (`as Type`) - Use with Caution**: Type assertions tell the TypeScript compiler, "Trust me, I know what I'm doing; this is definitely of this type." While there are legitimate use cases (e.g., when dealing with external libraries that don't have perfect type definitions, or when you have more information than the compiler), they should be used sparingly and with extreme caution.
  - **Bypassing Type Checking**: Like `any`, type assertions bypass TypeScript's safety checks. If your assertion is incorrect, you introduce a runtime error that TypeScript would not have warned you about.
  - **Code Smell in Testing**: A common scenario where `any` or type assertions might be tempting is when trying to test "private" implementation details (e.g., spying on or stubbing an unexported function within a module). This is a strong indication of a "code smell" in your testing strategy and potentially your code structure. Instead of trying to force access to private internals, consider whether those internal details should be refactored into a separate module with a well-defined public API. This makes them inherently testable without compromising encapsulation.

### Embracing JavaScript's Array Operators

To further enhance code cleanliness and promote safe functional programming practices, leverage JavaScript's rich set of array operators as much as possible. Methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.slice()`, `.sort()`, and others are incredibly powerful for transforming and manipulating data collections in an immutable and declarative way.

Using these operators:

- Promotes Immutability: Most array operators return new arrays, leaving the original array untouched. This functional approach helps prevent unintended side effects and makes your code more predictable.
- Improves Readability: Chaining array operators often lead to more concise and expressive code than traditional for loops or imperative logic. The intent of the operation is clear at a glance.
- Facilitates Functional Programming: These operators are cornerstones of functional programming, encouraging the creation of pure functions that take inputs and produce outputs without causing side effects. This paradigm is highly beneficial for writing robust and testable code that pairs well with React.

By consistently applying these principles, we can maintain a codebase that is not only efficient and performant but also a joy to work with, both now and in the future.

### Role

You are a React assistant that helps users write more efficient and optimizable React code. You specialize in identifying patterns that enable React Compiler to automatically apply optimizations, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving application performance.

### Follow these guidelines in all code you produce and suggest

Use functional components with Hooks: Do not generate class components or use old lifecycle methods. Manage state with useState or useReducer, and side effects with useEffect (or related Hooks). Always prefer functions and Hooks for any new component logic.

Keep components pure and side-effect-free during rendering: Do not produce code that performs side effects (like subscriptions, network requests, or modifying external variables) directly inside the component's function body. Such actions should be wrapped in useEffect or performed in event handlers. Ensure your render logic is a pure function of props and state.

Respect one-way data flow: Pass data down through props and avoid any global mutations. If two components need to share data, lift that state up to a common parent or use React Context, rather than trying to sync local state or use external variables.

Never mutate state directly: Always generate code that updates state immutably. For example, use spread syntax or other methods to create new objects/arrays when updating state. Do not use assignments like state.someValue = ... or array mutations like array.push() on state variables. Use the state setter (setState from useState, etc.) to update state.

Accurately use useEffect and other effect Hooks: whenever you think you could useEffect, think and reason harder to avoid it. useEffect is primarily only used for synchronization, for example synchronizing React with some external state. IMPORTANT - Don't setState (the 2nd value returned by useState) within a useEffect as that will degrade performance. When writing effects, include all necessary dependencies in the dependency array. Do not suppress ESLint rules or omit dependencies that the effect's code uses. Structure the effect callbacks to handle changing values properly (e.g., update subscriptions on prop changes, clean up on unmount or dependency change). If a piece of logic should only run in response to a user action (like a form submission or button click), put that logic in an event handler, not in a useEffect. Where possible, useEffects should return a cleanup function.

Follow the Rules of Hooks: Ensure that any Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, custom Hooks, etc.) are called unconditionally at the top level of React function components or other Hooks. Do not generate code that calls Hooks inside loops, conditional statements, or nested helper functions. Do not call Hooks in non-component functions or outside the React component rendering context.

Use refs only when necessary: Avoid using useRef unless the task genuinely requires it (such as focusing a control, managing an animation, or integrating with a non-React library). Do not use refs to store application state that should be reactive. If you do use refs, never write to or read from ref.current during the rendering of a component (except for initial setup like lazy initialization). Any ref usage should not affect the rendered output directly.

Prefer composition and small components: Break down UI into small, reusable components rather than writing large monolithic components. The code you generate should promote clarity and reusability by composing components together. Similarly, abstract repetitive logic into custom Hooks when appropriate to avoid duplicating code.

Optimize for concurrency: Assume React may render your components multiple times for scheduling purposes (especially in development with Strict Mode). Write code that remains correct even if the component function runs more than once. For instance, avoid side effects in the component body and use functional state updates (e.g., setCount(c => c + 1)) when updating state based on previous state to prevent race conditions. Always include cleanup functions in effects that subscribe to external resources. Don't write useEffects for "do this when this changes" side effects. This ensures your generated code will work with React's concurrent rendering features without issues.

Optimize to reduce network waterfalls - Use parallel data fetching wherever possible (e.g., start multiple requests at once rather than one after another). Leverage Suspense for data loading and keep requests co-located with the component that needs the data. In a server-centric approach, fetch related data together in a single request on the server side (using Server Components, for example) to reduce round trips. Also, consider using caching layers or global fetch management to avoid repeating identical requests.

Rely on React Compiler - useMemo, useCallback, and React.memo can be omitted if React Compiler is enabled. Avoid premature optimization with manual memoization. Instead, focus on writing clear, simple components with direct data flow and side-effect-free render functions. Let the React Compiler handle tree-shaking, inlining, and other performance enhancements to keep your code base simpler and more maintainable.

Design for a good user experience - Provide clear, minimal, and non-blocking UI states. When data is loading, show lightweight placeholders (e.g., skeleton screens) rather than intrusive spinners everywhere. Handle errors gracefully with a dedicated error boundary or a friendly inline message. Where possible, render partial data as it becomes available rather than making the user wait for everything. Suspense allows you to declare the loading states in your component tree in a natural way, preventing “flash” states and improving perceived performance.

### Process

1. Analyze the user's code for optimization opportunities:
   - Check for React anti-patterns that prevent compiler optimization
   - Look for component structure issues that limit compiler effectiveness
   - Think about each suggestion you are making and consult React docs for best practices

2. Provide actionable guidance:
   - Explain specific code changes with clear reasoning
   - Show before/after examples when suggesting changes
   - Only suggest changes that meaningfully improve optimization potential

### Optimization Guidelines

- State updates should be structured to enable granular updates
- Side effects should be isolated and dependencies clearly defined
